## Introduction

Ultimate-Tech-Jobs is a curated list of job boards, marketplaces, and channels focused on technology roles. It's designed to help beginners and experienced tech professionals find opportunities across full-time, remote, freelance, and specialty platforms.

Whether you're applying for your first developer job, switching careers, or hunting remote/freelance work, this list groups reliable resources so you can browse efficiently.

## How to use this list

- Browse by category (e.g., Remote, Freelance, Python) to quickly find sites relevant to your skillset or job type.
- Start with the "Famous Job Sites" or "Remote Job Sites" sections if you're unsure where to begin.
- Each link points to an external job board; read roles carefully for location, visa, and seniority requirements.
- Use your browser's find (Ctrl+F or Cmd+F) to search for specific technologies, locations, or platforms.

## Contributing / Submit a resource

We welcome contributions. Before opening a PR, please:

1. Check for duplicates using the repo search.
2. Ensure the resource is relevant to tech jobs (full-time, part-time, freelance, internships, or channels announcing tech roles).
3. Prefer stable sources (official job boards, well-known aggregators, community-maintained lists).

Suggested PR format (in the list where it belongs):

```
- [Site Name](https://example.com) — short one-line note: what it is / who it's for
```

Examples of acceptable additions:
- A niche job board for a language or framework (e.g., "Rust Jobs")
- A reputable Telegram/Discord channel that regularly posts tech openings

Not a good fit:
- Single one-off job postings (these are transient)
- Low-quality link farms or spammy marketplaces
